Hi, I'm @nerdteacher.

I do like collaborating with people, but I'm better on user perspectives regarding issues like ADHD, dyslexia, and audio-processing disorders. If you need help with accessibility
(or want to make a project focused on accessibility, particularly with regards to those three things), I'm always happy to help.

I can be reached at n@nerdteacher.com.

Sorry, I'm more of a writer than a programmer. I understand a lot of the basic principles, and I do my own web development.
